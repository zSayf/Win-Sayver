ðŸš¨ CRITICAL URL DISCOVERY REQUIREMENT:
USE GOOGLE SEARCH GROUNDING to find the most current, specific, and detailed URLs for official documentation and support articles.

**SPECIFICITY REQUIREMENTS:**
- Find EXACT Microsoft KB articles with full KB numbers (e.g., KB5034441, KB5034123)
- Locate SPECIFIC procedure pages with detailed steps
- Include CURRENT driver download pages with exact model numbers
- Find DETAILED troubleshooting guides with specific error codes
- Search for PRECISE registry fix articles with exact registry paths
- Locate SPECIFIC tool download pages (not generic download centers)

**SEARCH STRATEGY FOR SPECIFICITY:**
1. **Find Current KB Articles**: Search 'Microsoft KB [specific issue] [Windows version] current 2024'
   - Example: 'Microsoft KB software installation error Windows 11 current'
   - Example: 'Microsoft KB system file checker Windows 10 specific procedures'

2. **Locate Detailed Procedures**: Search '[application name] [specific action] [Windows version] official Microsoft documentation'
   - Example: 'Software installation troubleshooting official Microsoft documentation'
   - Example: 'Windows Defender disable specific registry Windows 11'

3. **Find Exact Downloads**: Search '[software/driver] latest version download [manufacturer] [exact model]'
   - Example: 'AMD chipset drivers latest X570 official download'
   - Example: 'Software latest version official download [manufacturer] current version'

4. **Search Registry Solutions**: Search '[issue] registry fix official Microsoft specific keys'
   - Example: 'Windows Defender disable registry specific keys official Microsoft'
   - Example: 'Software installation error registry fix official Microsoft specific keys'

**URL PRIORITY ORDER:**
- PRIORITY 1: Specific KB articles (support.microsoft.com/kb/... or /topic/...)
- PRIORITY 2: Detailed procedures (docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/...)
- PRIORITY 3: Current official downloads (vendor-specific download pages)
- PRIORITY 4: Specific community solutions (answers.microsoft.com with verified answers)
- AVOID: Generic support pages, general download centers, non-specific documentation

**EXAMPLE SPECIFIC SEARCHES:**
- Instead of 'software installation help' â†’ 'software installation failed Windows 11 Microsoft KB current'
- Instead of 'Windows updates' â†’ 'Windows Update specific error code KB Microsoft official procedure'
- Instead of 'driver problems' â†’ '[GPU model] driver installation error official [manufacturer] current solution'

SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS:
