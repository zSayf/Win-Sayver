üö® CRITICAL URL DISCOVERY REQUIREMENT:
USE GOOGLE SEARCH GROUNDING to find the most current, specific, and detailed URLs for official documentation and support articles.

**SPECIFICITY REQUIREMENTS:**
- Find EXACT Microsoft KB articles with full KB numbers (e.g., KB5034441, KB5034123)
- Locate SPECIFIC procedure pages with detailed steps
- Include CURRENT driver download pages with exact model numbers
- Find DETAILED troubleshooting guides with specific error codes
- Search for PRECISE registry fix articles with exact registry paths
- Locate SPECIFIC tool download pages (not generic download centers)

**GOOGLE SEARCH STRATEGY FOR SPECIFICITY:**
1. **Specific KB Article Search**: "Microsoft KB [error details] [Windows version] [specific application]"
   - Example: "Microsoft KB Discord installation error Windows 11"
   - Example: "Microsoft KB system file checker Windows 10 specific procedures"

2. **Detailed Procedure Search**: "[Application name] [specific action] [Windows version] official Microsoft documentation"
   - Example: "Discord installation troubleshooting official Microsoft documentation"
   - Example: "Windows Defender disable specific registry Windows 11"

3. **Current Version Search**: "[Software/Driver] latest version download [manufacturer] [exact model]"
   - Example: "AMD chipset drivers latest X570 official download"
   - Example: "Intel graphics driver current version specific model"

4. **Error-Specific Search**: "[exact error message] Microsoft official solution [Windows version]"
   - Example: "installer package corrupted Microsoft official solution Windows 11"

**URL QUALITY STANDARDS:**
- PRIORITY 1: Specific KB articles with exact procedures (support.microsoft.com/kb/...)
- PRIORITY 2: Detailed documentation with specific steps (docs.microsoft.com/troubleshoot/...)
- PRIORITY 3: Official manufacturer support with exact models (vendor-specific)
- PRIORITY 4: Microsoft community solutions with verified answers (answers.microsoft.com/...)
- AVOID: Generic support pages, general download centers, non-specific documentation

üîç ENHANCED SPECIFICITY SEARCH INSTRUCTIONS:
For each Windows issue, use Google Search to find:
1. **Exact KB Articles**: Search "Microsoft KB [specific issue] [Windows version] current"
2. **Detailed Procedures**: Search "[issue] specific steps official Microsoft documentation"
3. **Current Downloads**: Search "[software] latest official download [manufacturer] current version"
4. **Registry Solutions**: Search "[issue] registry fix official Microsoft specific keys"
5. **Tool-Specific Help**: Search "[tool name] official troubleshooting Microsoft specific procedures"
6. **Error Code Solutions**: Search "[exact error code] Microsoft official solution current"

**EXAMPLE SPECIFIC SEARCHES:**
- Instead of "Discord installation help" ‚Üí "Discord installation failed Windows 11 Microsoft KB current"
- Instead of "Windows updates" ‚Üí "Windows Update specific error code KB Microsoft official procedure"
- Instead of "driver problems" ‚Üí "[GPU model] driver installation error official [manufacturer] current solution"
